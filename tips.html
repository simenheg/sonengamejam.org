<h1>Tips</h1>
This section contains some general tips around the gamejam. Even if you are 
a grizzled veteran gamejammer, you probably want to at least read the section 
about our projector setup, to avoid presentation issues and ensure a flawless 
victory.

<h2>General life management</h2>
<p>
  48 hours is a short amount of time, and you will likely spend
  most of that either sleeping, eating or programming. Make sure to get
  enough sleep during the jam, and keep yourself hydrated —
  otherwise your productivity levels will suffer.
</p>

<p>
  If you are planning to stay for longer periods of time, make sure
  beforehand to bring the hygienic necessities. We provide access to water,
  tea, and coffee at all times, and we usually try to provide free food on
  certain days, to save you the trouble of getting food yourself. For the
  other times, you will need to bring your own food or cash – ask an
  organizer about nearby sources for food, if you don't already have
  a favorite place. We may occasionally organize pooled "food-runs",
  to save you the trouble of going to the store yourself.
</p>

<p>
  There is no need or requirement for you to actually be
  present at our locale at any particular point in time, save for the
  registrations and the showoff at the end. Some people prefer to
  go home, and program in a quieter environment. But that
  way, you will miss out on our cool talks, the free pizza, and general
  camaraderie, of course!
</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>
  Even before the theme is announced, you probably want to figure out who
  you want to team up with. Try to find people who either complement your
  skills well (such as artists if you are a programmer, etc.) or who are on
  the same page as you, so that you can work together on the same things. If
  you have two programmers on your team, it'll be beneficial if both
  know the same framework, or at the very least are both familiar with the
  same language you are going to use.
</p>

<p>
  Once you have found your teammates, and the topic is announced, it pays off
  to spend some time thinking about what you want to do. It's not unusual to
  spend an hour fleshing out your ideas. Having a clearer picture (and
  the same picture for every team-member) of what you want to do will help you to
  create more concise TODO lists, and help focusing your efforts better on
  the things that matter. Towards the end of the deadline, you will always
  have to kill off features that you originally planned to include, and the
  better you structured your priorities, the more graceful your game will
  degrade from "ideal" to "possible".
</p>

<h2>Ambitions</h2>
<p>
  Making a game in 48 hours is quite a challenge, so make sure to adjust
  your ambitions accordingly. Game jams are supposed to give you
  the possibility of implementing some cool ideas you want to try out,
  without having to waste too much time on it, if it doesn't work – and the
  given theme is supposed to restrict and focus you. But in the end, it is
  entirely up to you to determine what you want to work on, and what you
  want to achieve. Learning to use a new game-engine, a language you don't
  know yet, or even making your own game-engine may be very rewarding and
  teach you a lot, even if you end up with a sub-par game. If you want to
  focus on the actual game-design itself, it is most likely best that you
  chose a framework that you already know, that is quick to work with, and
  that doesn't place too much burden of low-level tasks on you.
</p>

<h2>The progression</h2>
<p>
  Unless you planned out your workflow very well beforehand (which nobody
  ever does), you'll likely experience quite a few ups and downs during the
  48 hours of development. In our experience, there is usually a
  particularly strong drop in optimism on the second day, when it looks like
  some of the cool features you initially thought possible will have to be
  dropped, the art style is still not coming together very well, et
  cetera. But don't give up at that point! If you keep at it, you will see
  that at some point things will suddenly start to come together, and your
  game will almost magically transform from "a bunch of stuff on the screen"
  into "hey, this is almost an enjoyable experience now!" in a fairly short
  amount of time.
</p>

<h2>The final sprint</h2>
<p>
  It is recommended that you, beforehand, designate a fixed amount of time
  prior to the deadline where you do a "feature-freeze" – for example, spend
  the last two hours only playtesting the game. This will help to re-focus
  your efforts; stop working on that drawing now, and fix these
  game-breaking bugs we just discovered instead! If you don't find anything
  particularly wrong with the game, you can still use the remaining time on
  the final polish.
</p>

<p>
  Remember also to pack up an archive of your game at least 15 minutes
  before the deadline! A common mistake is to attempt to send in
  the game 5 minutes prior to the deadline, only to find out that your
  gigabyte-sized game will take hours to upload through your 9600 baud
  modem. In the worst case, you can of course always just give your game to
  one of the organizers on a USB flash drive, or somesuch – we are generally
  fairly lenient with these kind of things, and may consider extending the
  deadlines by a few minute if it's only for the sake of technical
  difficulties.
</p>

<p>
  Use a version control system! BitBucket offers free private git and mercurial
  repositories, and github offers free public repositories, if you want to
  develop your game in the open. Even if you're the only person programming - A
  version control systems "revert" function can be your saviour, if you've coded
  yourself into a corner you need to back out of really fast.
</p>

<p>
  Remember to include your <strong>sourcecode</strong> and a <strong>screenshot</strong> with your
  final submission!
</p>

<h2>Making the most out of your presentation</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>
  At Sonen Game Jam, the winners are crowned immediately after the 
  presentations by popular vote. That has the advantage that you get to
  know right away whether you've won or not (and take your prizes
  home!), but it also means you have to put a little bit of thought into how
  you want to present your game, to convince people it's the
  greatest. Everybody gets about five to ten minutes, so you may find it
  valuable to think a bit on how to get the most out of your time. A lot of
  people make the mistake of starting up their game (which may have cool and
  complex emergent gameplay scenarios that take a bit of time to occur),
  play it for 60 seconds, say "well, that's about it" and then
  disappear. Use your time to the fullest, and make sure to explain
  non-obvious mechanics and strategies while you (or somebody else)
  play. Also make sure to choose a memorable game and team-name, to ensure
  that people remember which game was yours.
</p>

<h3>Video & audio</h3>
<p>
  Some notes about our setup and common issues:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The projector we use can display up to 1080p resolution, and has RCA,
    VGA, DVI, and HDMI (via DVI adapter) inputs.
  </li>

  <li>
    A lot of computers seem to incorrectly detect the max resolution via
    VGA, and will limit you to 1024x768 or so. Sometimes this can be forced
    higher, but don't depend on figuring it out when you are up for your
    presentation! You can test out the equipment at any point in time prior
    to the deadline (or even the game jam), so if you have doubts, make sure
    to test.
  </li>

  <li>
    If your game requires OS X to run, you have to bring your own OS X
    laptop/machine. What's more, you'll have to bring your own adapter for
    it.
  </li>

  <li>
    Sound is generally provided through a mini jack, not through HDMI.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Mirror</strong> your laptop screen to the projector, so that you can see yourself
    what you are doing!
  </li>

  <li>
    If your game(-engine) allows it, give it the option to run in windowed
    mode, even if you generally prefer fullscreen. Some systems have had the
    issue that screen mirroring worked fine, until the game switched into
    fullscreen mode, and mysteriously disabled one of the screens. Again:
    when in doubt, test it first!
  </li>

  <li>
    If possible, start up the game beforehand, so that you don't waste too
    much time fumbling around on your desktop.
  </li>

  <li>
    If you have technical difficulties (starting up your game, getting the
    projector to work, ...) we will generally allow you to fix the issue
    while other people are presenting, and then have another go at it.
  </li>

  <li>
    We will generally provide a <strong>high-end desktop computer</strong>
    that is connected to the projector via DVI at 1080p. So if you for
    some reason are unable to present your game from your laptop, but
    your game is able to run on a Linux system, we might be able to run
    it from our PC. Ideally, you should tell us about this beforehand.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Voting</h2>
<p>
  Everybody gets to vote, so make sure to use your voice! It's best to have
  a piece of paper around during the show-off, so that you can note down games
  you liked, for later reference. If you want to vote for a game, but you cannot
  remember the name, make sure to ask one of the organizers or ask the
  developer (or anybody else in the vicinity), they should be able to help
  you out. We will generally also interpret votes for "that game where you
  killed the space-pope" correctly, though...
</p>

<p>
  When voting, consider which game you thought was best overall. Some
  criteria you may want to consider could for instance be:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>relevance to the given theme</li>
  <li>best/most innovative game-mechanic</li>
  <li>best execution</li>
  <li>best artwork</li>
  <li>best soundtrack</li>
  <li>most hilarious</li>
  <li>best gameplay</li>
  <li>most technically impressive</li>
</ul>

<p>
  In the end, it's up to you, but try to make your vote fair and balanced!
</p>

<p>
  Sonen Game Jam is played in good faith, so please refrain from tactical
  voting et cetera.
